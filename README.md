# Breast Cancer Classification
## Classifying Breast Tumors Using Decision Tree
This project focuses on classifying breast tumor types using the Decision Tree model. The dataset used comes from Scikit-learn, which includes 30 features representing the characteristics of breast cancer cells. The main goal of this project is to classify tumors as malignant (dangerous) or benign (non-dangerous) based on these features. The dataset can be accessed via this link.

## Project Overview:
The dataset consists of 30 numeric features describing the characteristics of breast cancer cells, including size and shape of the cells, texture, and more. The target labels in this dataset are malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous).

## Project Goals:
1. Build a classification model using Decision Tree to classify breast tumors based on the available features.
2. Analyze the model's accuracy using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Apply cross-validation techniques to ensure the model is not overfitting.
4. Explore and visualize the decision tree to understand the rules generated by the model.

## Key Insights:
1. The Decision Tree model can produce accurate predictions with high accuracy rates.
2. Visualizing the decision tree provides deeper insights into the factors influencing breast tumor classification.
3. This model can serve as an aid in medical diagnostics, enabling faster and more accurate detection of breast tumor types, which is crucial in healthcare.
